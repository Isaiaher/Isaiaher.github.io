Hello, My name is Isaiah Scheel. I recently graduated from Pacific Lutheran University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in both Physics and Math with Magna Cum Laude honors. I was a Track and Field captain at PLU and also lead the Outdoor Recreation group on campus. I interned at the Pacific Northwest National Lab in the summer of 2018 and 2019. I am now seeking full time employment after graduation as a Software Engineer/Developer in hopes to be a full stack developer.

While attending Pacific Lutheran University, I was involved in a lot of different groups. Starting my Freshman year I became an Admissions Ambassador and hosted prospective students and gave tours. Starting my Sophomore year I became an RA, started running track for the school, and also started volunteering as an Outdoor Recreation Trip Leader. During my Junior year I started the STEM wing and was an RA for them and hosted STEM related activities in the residential hall. My Senior year I took on becoming the Outdoor Recreation Director and also became the captain of the Track and Field team. I accomplished all of this while getting my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science while also minoring in both Math and Physics. I graduated May 25, 2019 Magna Cum Laude.

Now that I have graduated I am really excited to start the next chapter in my life. I have found a deep love and excitement for the field of computer science. I love being challenged, but more importantly, I like the creative aspect to it and creating something I am proud of. I hope to get a job in an area that will allow me to continue to follow my passions of the outdoors with Rock Climbing, backpacking, and running.
