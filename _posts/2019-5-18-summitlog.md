For my senior capstone I developed an app using google's Fultter app framework. I was in a group of three and we had two semesters to design, implement, and present our project. We hit most of our goals and even won, the "Best Capstone Presentation" for our department at PLU.



### The idea of the App

The whole idea of the app came from me having a problem. I had too many places for all of my electronic hiking data. If I had a hike I wanted to do, I would store it in google docs, my notes app or just try to remember it. For pictures of hikes, I would use Facebook, Instagram and store them on various computers/external hard drives. This is where the idea of Summit Log came from.

Our solution was to make a mobile app that took all of these use cases and made an easy, clean, and professional app.

Here are some of the functional goals that we were trying to achieve

### Title Screen

This is the title screen to the app. We used Flutter for the front end and Google's Firebase for the backend. We were able to set up a Facebook developer account and make a "Facebook app" to allow us to use Facebook as a log in option.

### Homescreen

The main screen where your list of hikes to do are located.

<amp-img src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/images/homescreen_done.png" width="100" height="200" layout="responsive" alt="" class="mb3"></amp-img>

One screen over where the hikes you have done are located. The user can store pictures here, a trip description, date, longitude and latitude.

### The Drawer and Other Hikers

The navigation drawer to get around the app easier. If you click on "Hikers" it brings you to a page with all the other hikers on the app

### Your Profile

### Map and Other Hikers

Within the map you can look at where you have been and also where your friends have been.
