  <ul>
    <li>An article I was interviewed for and asked primarily the question, "What does success mean to you?". I found being interviewed for this article very honoring. It was published in the Resolute, a quarterly magazine that is sent to all current students, alumni and their families. I am the second profile in the article. I also took the photo of myself.</li>

    <ul>
    <li>This article was published in a different Resolute edition than the above and I was interviewed in it because I was the current Outdoor Rec director. Outdoor Rec is an organization on PLU's campus that take students on outdoor trips at least once a weekend. We have a group of volunteer trip leaders and usually two paid directors. I had the honor to be a director my senior year and lead the group. I also took nuerous photos in this article. </li>

    <ul>
    <li>An article I was interviewed for because my co-director for OR (Outdoor Rec) and I both ran track and were the OR directors. The university saw how challenging and time consuming that may have been and wanted to do an article on how we balance that lifestyle.</li>
